#The Little Javascripter Solutions#

These are my solutions to [The Little Schemer](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/) in Javascript using [Douglas Crockford's The Little Javascripter](http://javascript.crockford.com/little.html).

Answers are divided by chapter to avoid namespace collisions. Doug wrote the same function multiple times, as the book goes. My answers are in the solutions-cxx.js files and housed within the lilJSter object.

I suggest opening the HTML files to test the solutions.

Word.

A note on recursion in Javascript:
Use recursion with caution. JS engines typically fail with too many levels of recursion.
